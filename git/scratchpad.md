# Git Remotes

1. Check Current Remotes
Before making changes, it's a good idea to verify the existing remotes. Use:

``git remote -v`

2. Remove the Upstream Remote
If you see an upstream remote that you no longer need, remove it with:

`git remote remove upstream`

3. If you accidentally remove the wrong remote, you can re-add it using:

`git remote add <name> <URL>`

-----------------

# Starting from creating a repo locally and uploading to GitHub
If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that projectâ€™s directory.  
mkdir your-repository  
cd your-repository/  
echo "# your-repository" >> README.md  
git init  
git add README.md  
git status  
git commit -m "first commit" -m "Just a description"  
git remote add origin git@github.com:m4testingaccount/your-repository.git  
git remote -v  
git push origin main  

8. Pulling and Pushing Changes  
Pull latest changes:  

git pull origin main  

Push local commits:  
git push origin main
